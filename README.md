# EO foundational model inference and fine tuning (self-directed training)

## To do list

- Run inference.py but with the weights from a fine-tuned crop classification model (e.g., Prithvi-EO-1.0-100M-multi-temporal-crop-classification)
  - might need to  get a specific inference.py script

## Notes

- Until now (Friday, November 21), I was running inference with the foundational model. The foundational model is desgined to form the basis of fine-tuning for a specific purpose (e.g., flooding).
